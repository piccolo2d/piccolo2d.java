	* ported Jazz's ZTransformGroup.postion() method to PNode
	* don't use media tracker to load images in PImage if the image is a BufferedImage
	* fixed PAffineTransform.getRotation() method
	* fixed PPaintContext so that it can be created with a Graphics2D that has a null clip
	
=Piccolo 1.0-beta2 Release Notes=
------------------

  * Removed Piccolo abstract rendered and OpenGL support code, instead we are planning to use a new library, Agile2D. Agile2D provides its own OpenGL implementation of the java.awt.Graphics2D class.

piccolo/examples
	* added clip example
	* added internal lens example
	* added panToExample to illustrate Pcamera’s animateViewToIncludeBounds method
	* added scrolling example
	* added selection example
	* added text example to show how to use PStyledTextEventHandler to edit text directly on the piccolo canvas.

piccolo/extras
	* added PSelectionEventHandler
	* added PStyledTextEventHandler
	* added PClip
	* added PLens
	* added PStyledText, used together with PStyledTextEvent handler to edit text on the piccolo canvas.
	* added a number of scroll supported classes in the extras swing package.

piccolo/src

PCamera
	* renamed centerView to animateViewToBounds
	* added animateViewToIncludeBounds

PNode
	* renamed translateRelativeToParent() to offset()
	* transform var is only created when needed, otherwise it's now left as null
	* added getClientPropertyKeysIterator()
	* added rotateInPlace()
	* renamed getTranslation() to getOffset()
	* renamed setTranslation() to setOffset()
	* renamed translateRelativeToParent() to offset()
	* renamed deltete() to removeFromParent()

PInputManager
	* added tracking for individual mouse button pressed. This way if you press down on a node with button1 that node will stay as mouse focus as long as button1 is pressed, event if button2 is repeatedly pressed and released.

PCanvas
	* added animating render quality, this quality is used if any of the scheduled activities return true when sent the message isAnimation().
	* added checks to make sure that every mouse press gets matched with a mouse released, something to does not always happen in swing.

PCamera
	* added some view constraint options. These are used to constrain the cameras view to the bounds of the layers that the camera is viewing.
	* renamed centerView() to animateViewToBounds()
	* added animateViewToIncludeBounds()

PInputEvent
	* removed consume() replaced with setHandled(). Previously consuming an event would completely stop it from getting dispatched to anyone else. Set handled is a weaker command, the event continues to get dispatched to other event handlers but they are expected to ignore it unless they are trying to do something special.

PImage
	* changed the default so that images are NOT accelerated.

PPath
	* removed getStrokeWidth(), Strokes are now just dealt with as shapes that are created by stroke.createStrokedShape(path). 

PText 
	* added setConstrainWidthToTextWidth()
	* added setConstrainHeightToTextHeight()

PAffineTransform
	* renamed setTranslation to setOffset()

PBounds
	*added deltaRequiredToContain()

PDebug
	* added options to debugMemoryUse and set the frame rate at which debug results are calculated.

PPaintContext
	* removed drawing methods, and abstract renderer in general. Instead all drawing should be done directly with the Graphics2D object.

PUtil
	* added DEFAULT_ACTIVITY_STEP_RATE = 20;
	* added ACTIVITY_SCHEDULER_FRAME_DELAY = 10;
