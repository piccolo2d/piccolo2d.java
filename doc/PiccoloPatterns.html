<h1>Patterns For Piccolo</h1>
<p><b>This work is based heavily on the work of R. Johnson in his seminal 1992
paper &quot;Documenting Frameworks using Patterns&quot; and the work of Douglas
Kirk in his “Patterns for JHotDraw paper”. This work merely attempts to
adapt the concepts presented there into a format suitable for our Piccolo
framework.</b></p>
<h2><a name="Pattern 1 Zooming User Interfaces (ZUI's)"></a>Pattern 1: Zooming
User Interfaces (ZUI’s)</h2>
<p><i>Piccolo</i><i> is a framework building zooming user interfaces. The
elements of these interfaces can be scaled, react to user input, and be
animated. The user viewpoint may be scaled and panned. Interfaces build with Piccolo
can define your entire applications interface, or they can be a small part of a
large system.</i></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="zoomsequence.jpg" width="450" height="146"></p>
<p>Figure 1 shows a sequence of frames from a simple zooming interface created
using Piccolo. This example shows the fundamental aspects of a Piccolo
application. In this sequence the user is zooming in on a &quot;Hello
world!&quot; interface
object.</p>
<p>The interface objects on the canvas are nodes (instances of PNode), in this
case a PText node. Nodes are used represent the
discrete components of an interface. The framework comes with some commonly
required nodes (shapes, images, and text) and the developer has the opportunity to define new ones for
their own interfaces.</p>
<p>Figure 1’s zooming interaction was created with the help of an event
listener (instances of PInputEventListener). Event listeners define how the
interface reacts to user input. In this zooming interaction the event listener
reacted to mouse input by manipulating the camera node's view transform to
create the zooming effect. Piccolo comes with ready-made event listeners for
zooming and panning camera nodes, and dragging nodes on the canvas.</p>
<p>All Piccolo interfaces need to be placed in a PCanvas so that they may be
viewed and interacted with by the user. The canvas is a subclass of JComponent
so it may easily be integrated with Java Swing applications. In addition to
hosting Piccolo in a Swing interface the canvas also maintains a camera and
layer node. Scaling and translating the camera's view transform over time is how
zooming and panning of the Piccolo interface is accomplished. New nodes are
normally added to the canvas's layer node.</p>
<p>The interface depicted in figure 1 can be created with the following code:</p>
<pre>import edu.umd.cs.piccolo.PCanvas;
import edu.umd.cs.piccolo.nodes.PText;
import edu.umd.cs.piccolox.PFrame;

// The PFrame class is a utility class that creates a new java window
// and adds a PCavnas to it. You can override the initialize method and
// start building your interface there.
public class PiccoloExample extends PFrame {
	public void initialize() {
		PNode aNode = new PText(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);		

		// Add the node to the canvas layer so that it
		// will be displayed on the screen.
		getCanvas().getLayer().addChild(aNode);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new PiccoloExample();
	}
}</pre>
<p>This creates the default zooming interface. A new text node is added to
the surface, and event handlers for zooming and panning are automatically
installed by the PCanvas.</p>

<h2><a name="Building Piccolo"></a>Pattern 2: Building Piccolo</h2>
<p><i>To use Piccolo you will need to add the appropriate .jar files to your
classpath, and to do that you need to know what each .jar file contains, and how
to build the piccolo framework.</i></p>
<p>Piccolo comes with 4 .jar files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>piccolo.jar - This .jar contains the Piccolo 2d zooming graphics
    framework.</li>
  <li>piccolox.jar - This .jar contains the Piccolo extras, and it depends on
    piccolo.jar</li>
  <li>examples.jar - This .jar contains simple examples of Piccolo, it depends
    on piccolo.jar and piccolox.jar.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>tests.jar - This .jar contains unit tests for classes in the Piccolo
    framework, it depends on piccolo.jar and /lib/junit.jar</li>
</ul>
<p>If you downloaded the compiled distribution of piccolo these .jar files are
located for you in piccolo/build/. If you didn't then you will need to build
them yourself. This is done by typing 'build all' from within the piccolo/
folder.</p>
<p>Piccolo also comes with project files for the Eclipse IDE (www.eclipse.org),
this is our favorite development environment for Piccolo, and Java in
general.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Pattern 2 Creating Nodes"></a>Pattern 3: Creating Nodes</h2>
<p><i>There are an infinite variety of nodes that can be included in a zooming
user interface. Thus, their needs to be a way to make new nodes for each
application.</i></p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Use existing classes:</b> Piccolo is supplied with the default
    implementations for three kinds of visual node, PText, PPath, and PImage.
    These may be used ‘as is’ in new applications, this saves developers the
    time and effort required to create such elements themselves but reduces the
    knowledge the developer has about how that figure is implemented.</li>
  <li><b>Subclass existing classes:</b> Often the default implementations of PNodes
    are ‘almost but not quite’ what is required by an interface. In such
    circumstances it makes sense to customize the existing node to fit the
    interfaces needs. This saves time compared with starting from scratch and
    provides insight into the organization of that node but sub classing will
    increase the number of classes in the system and carries the responsibility
    of ensuring that the original intent of that inheritance hierarchy is
    maintained.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Composition:</b> An alternative to sub classing, composition can be
    used in situations where the new functionality required can be created by
    arranging several pre existing nodes together. e.g. A text label could be
    defined as a rectangle (to define the border) with a text object inside. To facilitate this kind of
    creation any node may have other child nodes added to them. Adding a text
    node as a child of the rectangle node could create the text label mentioned
    above. Composition frees the developer from class details, can reuse
    existing tools and allows dynamic configuration (new arrangements of figures
    can be constructed while the program runs). Against it, composition doesn’t
    provide as much freedom as sub classing (it can only compose what is
    available) and it can be difficult to debug due to its dynamic nature.</li>
  <li><b>Custom Node:</b> The ultimate amount of creative freedom comes from sub
    classing PNode directly. PNode already provides default behavior for all
    operations (it is a concrete class) so it is fairly easy to subclass. Many subclasses
    will want to&nbsp;override the setBounds(),
    intersects(), and paint() methods.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each visual interface element in Piccolo is a subclass of PNode. Nodes can be
used directly or customized by sub classing or composition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following code defines a new simple (without a border) ellipse node.</p>
<pre>public class SimpleEllipseNode extends PNode {
	private Ellipse2D ellipse;

	// This nodes uses an internal Ellipse2D to define its shape.
	public Ellipse2D getEllipse() {
		if (ellipse == null) ellipse = new Ellipse2D.Double();
		return ellipse;
	}

	// This method is important to override so that the geometry of 
	// the ellipse stays consistent with the bounds geometry.
	public boolean setBounds(double x, double y, double width, double height) {
		if(super.setBounds(x, y, width, height)) {
			ellipse.setFrame(x, y, width, height);
			return true;
		}
		return false;
	}

	// Non rectangular subclasses need to override this method so
	// that they will be picked correctly and will receive the
	// correct mouse events.
	public boolean intersects(Rectangle2D aBounds) {
		return getEllipse().intersects(aBounds);
	}

	// Nodes that override the visual representation of their super
	// class need to override a paint method.
	public void paint(PPaintContext aPaintContext) {
		Graphics2D g2 = aPaintContext.getGraphics(); 
		g2.setPaint(getPaint());
		g2.fill(getEllipse());
	}
}</pre>
<ul>
  <li>To let the user change the attributes of a node, see <a href="#Pattern 3 Adding User Interaction">Adding
    user Interaction</a></li>
  <li>To constrain the layout of a nodes children, see <a href="#Pattern 4 Layout Constraints">Layout
    Constraints</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Pattern 3 Adding User Interaction"></a>Pattern 4: Adding User
Interaction</h2>
<p><i>Event listeners represent the modes of interaction between the user and
the interface. Piccolo comes with event listeners that let the user zoom and pan
their viewpoint, and drag nodes in the interface. An important part of designing
an interface using Piccolo is to design the set of event listeners that will
define the user experience.</i></p>
<p>Once created an event listener must be registered with a node so that it can receive
events. Many event handlers register with the camera node so that they get all
events that come from the canvas associated with that camera.</p>
<p>This example class creates an event listener that will create rectangle nodes
on the canvas's layer when the user presses, drags, and then releases the mouse.</p>
<pre>// This event listener works by keeping track of the mouse press
// location and the current mouse drag location. It then sizes the new
// rectangle around those points. Note: The implementation of this event
// handler could be simplified by sub classing PDragSequenceEventHandler. 
public class RectangleCreationEventHandler extends PBasicInputEventHandler {
	// The rectangle that is currently getting created.
	protected PPath rectangle;
			
	// The mouse press location for the current pressed, drag, release sequence.
	protected Point2D pressPoint;
			
	// The current drag location.
	protected Point2D dragPoint;
		
	public void mousePressed(PInputEvent e) {
		super.mousePressed(e);			
				
		PLayer layer = e.getCanvas().getLayer();

		// Initialize the locations.
		pressPoint = e.getPosition();
		dragPoint = pressPoint;				
				
		// create a new rectangle and add it to the canvas layer so that
		// we can see it.
		rectangle = new PPath();
		rectangle.setStroke(new BasicStroke((float)(1/ e.getCamera().getViewScale())));
		layer.addChild(rectangle);
				
		// update the rectangle shape.
		updateRectangle();
	}
			
	public void mouseDragged(PInputEvent e) {
		super.mouseDragged(e);
		// update the drag point location.
		dragPoint = e.getPosition();	
				
		// update the rectangle shape.
		updateRectangle();
	}
		
	public void mouseReleased(PInputEvent e) {
		super.mouseReleased(e);
		// update the rectangle shape.
		updateRectangle();
		rectangle = null;
	}	
		
	public void updateRectangle() {
		// create a new bounds that contains both the press and current
		// drag point.
		PBounds b = new PBounds();
		b.add(pressPoint);
		b.add(dragPoint);
		
		// Set the rectangles bounds.
		rectangle.setPathTo(b);
	}
}</pre>
<p>The code to register this event listener with the canvas would look like
this:</p>
<pre>getCanvas().addInputEventListener(new RectangleCreationEventHandler());</pre>
<p>Note that this event handler reacts to the same events that the zoom and pan
event handlers react to. If they are all active on the canvas at the same time
undesired behavior would occur. A general problem when defining global event
handlers is making sure that they do not conflict in this way. The class
PInputEventFilter can help in this regard. Often you will want to remove the
default pan and zoom event handlers associated with the PCanvas, this can be
done as follows:</p>
<pre>getCanvas().removeInputEventListener(getCanvas().getZoomEventHandler());
getCanvas().removeInputEventListener(getCanvas().getPanEventHandler());</pre>

    Systems</a></li>
  <li>To learn more about event dispatch, see <a href="#Pattern 10 Dispatching Events">Dispatching
    Events</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Pattern 4 Layout Constraints"></a>Pattern 5: Layout Constraints</h2>
<p><i>Often an interface has constraints that must be maintained between a node
and its children. For example a node may want to always make its children line
up in a row or a node may wish to expand its base size to always fully contain
the bounds of its children.</i></p>
<p>The PNode class does no automatic layout of its own, but it provides
methods that subclasses can override to perform layout in the appropriate place during
the layout process.. The following is
a simple layout node that overrides and lays its children out in a
horizontal row.</p>
<pre>PNode layoutNode = new PNode() {
	public void layoutChildren() {
		double xOffset = 0;
		double yOffset = 0;
			
		Iterator i = getChildrenIterator();
		while (i.hasNext()) {
			PNode each = (PNode) i.next();
			each.setOffset(xOffset - each.getX(), yOffset);
			xOffset += each.getFullBoundsReference().getWidth();
		}
	}
};</pre>
This layout code will automatically be called when the bounds of the layout node
change, or when the fullBounds of any of the layout node's children change.
<ul>
  <li>For more information on the layout process, see <a href="#Pattern 12 Validating Bounds">Validating Bounds</a></li>
  <li>For more information on the "full" term used in fullBounds, see <a href="#Pattern 7 Full Terminology">Full
    Terminology</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Pattern 5 Activities"></a>Pattern 6: Activities</h2>
<p><i>Event handlers let an interface react to a user. Actives
are used to give the interface a life of its own through the use of animation
and other &quot;scheduled&quot; behaviors.</i></p>
<p>Activities (subclasses of PActivity) control some time-dependent aspect of
the Piccolo system, usually some part of a node. This behavior may be of fixed
duration or may continue until some termination condition is met (or perhaps
forever). Activities of fixed duration may be defined to consume a fixed amount
of time, independent of the frame rate.</p>
<p>This method sets up a flash activity that flashes the given node's color from
red to green for 5 seconds.</p>
<pre>public void flashNode(final PNode aNode) {
	PActivity flash = new PActivity(5000) {
		boolean fRed = true;
	
		protected void step(long time) {
			super.step(time);		
			if (fRed) {
				aNode.setPaint(Color.red);
			} else {
				aNode.setPaint(Color.green);
			}		
			fRed = !fRed;
		}
	};
	// Must schedule the activity with the root for it to run.
	aNode.getRoot().<font SIZE="2">addActivity(</font>flash);
}
</pre>
<p>Activities are scheduled by the PRoot until they have completed. Note
that for animation activities you can also use the convenience methods in PNode:</p>
<pre>public PTransformActivity animateToPositionScaleRotation(double x, double y, double scale, double theta, long duration);
public PTransformActivity animateToTransform(AffineTransform aDestination, long duration);</pre>
<p>Each activity has a start time and a duration, that together determine when
an activity starts stepping and how long it continues to step. The <font face="Courier">PActivity.startAfter()</font>
method may be used to sequence an activity so that it starts right after another
has stopped.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To learn more about activities see, <a href="#Pattern 11 Processing Activities">Processing
    Activities</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Pattern 6 SWT"></a>Pattern 7: Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT)
connection</h2>
<p><i>SWT is a new Java toolkit (similar to and replacing Swing) that comes out
of the Eclipse IDE project. Piccolo was originally designed to work with swing,
but now has <b> preliminary</b> SWT support as well. You will most likely use SWT if you
are writing Piccolo extensions to the Eclipse IDE. See <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">www.eclipse.org</a>
for more info on the Eclipse project.</i></p>
<p>Again SWT support is not complete. We are interested in your feedback and
hope it is of use, but we can not promise future updates. SWT support is provided in the extras package in edu.umd.cs.piccolox.swt, and
you will find SWT examples in the examples package.&nbsp;Here is the code for SWT hello world:</p>
<pre>public class SWTHelloWorld {

	public SWTHelloWorld() {
		super();
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Display display = new Display ();
		Shell shell = open(display);
		while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
			if (!display.readAndDispatch()) display.sleep();
		}
		display.dispose();
	}
	
	public static Shell open(Display display) {
		final Shell shell = new Shell(display);
		shell.setLayout(new FillLayout());
		PSWTCanvas canvas = new PSWTCanvas(shell,0);
		
		PSWTText text = new PSWTText(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
		canvas.getLayer().addChild(text);
		
		shell.open();
		return shell;
	}
}</pre>
<h1><a name="Implementation Patterns for Piccolo"></a>Implementation Patterns
for Piccolo</h1>
<p>The Piccolo implementation patterns are designed to give a general
understanding of how Piccolo is implemented and what its runtime behaviors are.
This is opposed to the patterns in <a href="#Usage Patterns For Piccolo">Usage
Patterns For Piccolo</a> that are designed to get you using the framework as
quickly as possible.</p>
<h2><a name="Pattern 6 Piccolo Framework Design"></a>Pattern 8: Piccolo
Framework Design</h2>
<p align="left"><i>You should be familiar with the basic concepts of the Piccolo framework
design and how they relate to each other to effectively use Piccolo.</i></p>
<p>Piccolo is a direct-manipulation graphics framework that supports
constructing zooming interfaces. The framework's design borrows heavily from the
designs of both the Jazz and Morphic interface frameworks.</p>
<p align="center"><i><img border="0" src="piccolo_hierachy.gif" width="321" height="177"></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Piccolo Class </i><i>Hierarchy</i></p>
<p>There are four main classes that define the framework's core:</p>
<ol>
  <li>PNode (anything that is visible and gets events)</li>
  <li>PCamera (a node that looks at other layer nodes, and applies a view
    transform)</li>
  <li>PLayer (a node that can be looked at by a camera)</li>
  <li>PRoot (the root of the Piccolo display tree)</li>
  <li>PCanvas (the host JComponet that lets PNodes exist in a Java Swing
    application, each PCanvas is associated with a PCamera. But all cameras are
    not necessarily directly associated with a PCanvas, internal cameras for
    example are not.)</li>
</ol>
<p align="center"><i><img border="0" src="piccolo_runtime.gif" width="236" height="177"></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Piccolo Runtime Structure</i></p>
<p align="left">At runtime these classes form a tree like structure with the
PRoot situated at the top. Each PCamera is normally linked with at least one
PLayer that it looks at through it's view transform. If a camera is associated
with a PCanvas then that cameras view is displayed on the canvas, and input
events from the canvas enter the Piccolo scene graph at that camera's point in
the hierarchy.</p>
<h3>PNode</h3>
<p>Nodes are the central design concept in Piccolo. Any object that wants to
paint itself on the screen should inherit from the node class. In addition to
painting on the screen all nodes may have other
&quot;child&quot; nodes added to them. Visual structures are build up by
grouping and sub grouping collections of nodes.</p>
<p>Each node also has its own AffineTransform that is applied before the node is
drawn to the screen. This transform can be modified to scale and translate the
node. This transform exits directly above the node, but below the nodes parent.
I.E. translating it will translate the node (and all its descendents) but will
not translate the node's parent.</p>
<h3>PCamera</h3>
<p>Cameras are are nodes that have an additional transform (viewTransform) and a
collection of layers in addition to the collection of children that they inherit
from PNode. The view transform is applied before drawing or picking
the layers, but not when drawing or picking the camera's children. Cameras may
(an internal camera might not) also reference a PCanvas, and forward repaint
events to that canvas. The canvas would then later ask the camera to draw the
damaged region on its surface.</p>
<h3>PLayer</h3>
<p>Layer nodes are nodes that can be viewed by a one or more cameras. They maintain
a list of the cameras that are viewing them, and notify these cameras when they
are repainted.</p>
<h3>PRoot</h3>
<p>The PRoot serves as the topmost node in the Piccolo runtime structure;
all other nodes are its direct children or descendents of its children.
The PCanvas communicates with the root node to manage screen updates and to
dispatch events to its children.</p>
<h3>PCanvas</h3>
<p>The PCanvas is a JComponent that is used to view a Piccolo scene graph in a
Swing application. The PCanvas views the scene graph through a PCamera. It
forwards swing input events to that camera, and uses that camera to draw itself.
Translating and scaling that camera's view transform is how panning and zooming
are accomplished.</p>
<h2><a name="Pattern 7 Full Terminology"></a>Pattern 9: Full
Terminology</h2>
<p><i>Many of PNode's methods work on the composite structure (the node plus all
its descendents) of the node. It is helpful to be able to easily distinguish
these methods from ones that only work directly on the node and not on its
children.</i></p>
<p>Piccolo uses the terms &quot;full&quot; to help
distinguish between methods that work on a single node and those that work on a
node together with all of its descendants. For example:</p>
<pre>// Returns the bounding box of the given node.
aNode.getBounds();

// Returns the bounds of the given node combined with the bounds of
// all of the descendants of that node. Descendants need not be contained
// in the bounds of their parent, so this full bounds value may be 
// larger then the bounds, but it will never be smaller.
aNode.getFullBounds();

// This will paint just &quot;aNode&quot; and not any of its children. Normally this
// method is automatically called from the fullPaint method.
aNode.paint(aPaintContext);

// This will paint &quot;aNode&quot; together will all of that node's descendents.
aNode.fullPaint(aPaintContext);</pre>
<p>Subclasses should generally not override the &quot;full&quot; methods, since
they are implemented in terms of other methods that can be overridden.</p>
<h2><a name="Pattern 8 Coordinate Systems"></a>Pattern 10: Coordinate Systems</h2>
<p><i>Each node in Piccolo has its own transform and uses that to define its own
coordinate system. It is essential that you understand coordinate systems, and
how to convert from one coordinate system to another when designing a zooming
user interface.</i></p>
<p>There may be thousands of different coordinate systems in a Piccolo interface
(a different one for each node), but they can all be organized into three
categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Local:</b> The local coordinate system is specific to a single node.
    This coordinate system exists directly below that nodes transform. The base
    bounds of a node are kept in this local coordinate system, while the
    fullBounds of a node are stored in the local coordinate system of the nodes
    parent. (This means that the full bounds of a node have been transformed up
    through the node's transform, but are still below the node's parent's
    transform).&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Global:</b> The global coordinate system exists above the root node's
    transform, but below the canvas's view transform. The global coordinate
    system serves as a common coordinate system that can be used as an
    intermediate when converting from the local coordinates of one node to that
    of another node.</li>
  <li><b>Canvas:</b> The canvas coordinate system is equal to the the Java Swing coordinate system of the
    PCanvas.</li>
</ol>
<p>Piccolo provides methods that let you easily convert between different
coordinate systems. The PNode class defines the methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>localToGlobal - Transform up from a node's local coordinate system into
    the global coordinates..</li>
  <li>globalToLocal - Transform down from global coordinate system into a node's
    local coordinates.</li>
  <li>localToParent - Transform up from a nodes local coordinate system into the
    node's parent's local coordinates.</li>
  <li>parentToLocal - Transform down from a node's parent's local coordinate
    system into the node's local coordinates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a typical example of how coordinate systems are used:</p>
<pre>// This method connects the centers of two 
// rectangle nodes with a line node. If you know that two nodes
// exist in the same coordinate system then you don't need to make
// all these conversions. This example assumes the most general case where
// they all exist in different coordinate systems.
public void connectRectsWithLine(PPath rect1, PPath rect2,  PPath line) {

	// First get the center of each rectangle in the 
	// local coordinate system of each rectangle.
	Point2D r1c = rect1.getBounds().getCenter2D();		
	Point2D r2c = rect2.getBounds().getCenter2D();

	// Next convert that center point for each rectangle 
	// into global coordinate system.		
	rect1.localToGlobal(r1c);
	rect2.localToGlobal(r2c);

	// Now that the centers are in global coordinates they 
	// can be converted into the local coordinate system 
	// of the line node.		
	line.globalToLocal(r1c);
	line.globalToLocal(r2c);

	// Finish by setting the endpoints of the line to 
	// the center points of the rectangles, now that those
	// center points are in the local coordinate system of the line.
	line.setPathTo(new Line2D.Double(r1c, r2c));
}</pre>
<h2><a name="Pattern 9 UI Cycle"></a>Pattern 11: UI Cycle</h2>
<p><i>The root node's UI Cycle is at the center of Piccolo's runtime behavior
where it drives the processes for processing user input, activities, bounds management, and scheduling repaints.</i></p>
<p>The PRoot class is responsible for running the UI Cycle. During each
cycle it performs four actions:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Process Inputs:</b> Any new input event from Swing is passed to the
    dispatch manager which will then dispatch the event to the appropriate
    PInputEventListeners in the interface..</li>
  <li><b>Process Activities:</b> All activities that are ready to run are given
    a chance to do so.</li>
  <li><b>Validate Bounds:</b> All invalided bounds are updated, and bounds
    caches filled.</li>
  <li><b>Update Display:</b> Damage is collected for all areas of the screen
    that need to be repainted and this is sent to the Swing repaint manager.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Piccolo UI loop is always driven from the Java event dispatch thread. A
UI cycle is done for each new input event received by the canvas, and for each
time the activity timer fires (to support animation).</p>

<h2><a name="Threads"></a>Pattern 12: Threads</h2>
<p><i>Piccolo is not thread safe and should only be used by a single thread at a
time, and that thread will almost always be the event dispatch thread.</i></p>
<p>If you need to run a computation in another thread you should use the methods
SwingUtilities.invokeLater() or SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait() to connect the
results of your computation back up to the event dispatch thread. The Java Swing
toolkit has a similar policy, read <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/overview/threads.html">Threads
and Swing</a> to learn more about these issues.</p>
<h2><a name="Pattern 10 Dispatching Events"></a>Pattern 13: Dispatching Events</h2>
<p><i>Event dispatch is the process through which Piccolo directs new events
coming from the user to event handlers in the interface.</i></p>
<p>All event dispatch is managed by the input manager (PInputManager). Events get to the dispatch manager by first coming off
the java event queue, next they are sent by java to the canvas (PCanvas) and the
canvas forwards them to the input manager.</p>
<p>Once there the input manger converts the event from a java.awt.InputEvent
into a PInputEvent. Next the input manager then sends the incoming event to
the event listeners of the appropriate nodes. The dispatch manager maintains the following focus nodes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Keyboard Focus</b> - The node that gets key events sent to it (Usually
    defined when the mouse is pressed)</li>
  <li><b>Mouse Over Focus</b> - The the node that the mouse cursor is over. When
    a node first becomes the current mouse over node it is sent a mouse entered
    event, and when the mouse leaves it is sent a mouse exited event.</li>
  <li><b>Mouse Focus</b> - The mouse focus node is sent mouse pressed, dragged,
    and released events. When the mouse is pressed the dispatch manager gets the
    mouse over focus, and makes it the mouse focus node as well. This mouse
    focus node is sent all events from that mouse pressed, dragged, released
    sequence. After the release event arrives the dispatch manager sets the
    mouse focus back to null.</li>
</ul>
<p>Events are dispatched up the PPickPath associated with a given focus node, so
they percolate up the pick path until they are consumed or they reach the
originating camera node.</p>
<p>TIP: You can always get a reference to the dispatch manager from a PInputEvent, and ask it for the current focus nodes.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Pattern 11 Processing Activities"></a>Pattern 14: Processing
Activities</h2>
<p><i>All scheduled activities are given a chance to run during
the UI Cycle.</i></p>
<p>Activities are used to control some time dependent aspect of the Piccolo
framework, for example they can be used to animate a node across the screen, or
animate the camera's view transform to perform a zoom.</p>
<h2><a name="Pattern 12 Validating Bounds"></a>Pattern 15: Validating Bounds</h2>
<p><i>When the geometry of a node changes its bounds caches need to be
recomputed and the geometry of other related nodes may also be effected.</i></p>
<p>Maintaining bounds caches and updating layouts can become very expensive when
manipulating a large number of nodes. Because of this Piccolo uses a two stage
incremental approach the layout management. The two stages consist of; a damage
stage where damage is recorded in bit flags for each damaged node, and an
incremental repair stage where the damage is repaired as is needed.</p>
<p>The damage stage begins when some node geometry changes. When this happens
the type of damage that occurred is recorded for each node. The are three kinds
of damage that can occur:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>bounds invalidated</b> - This damage is recorded whenever the bounds of a node change.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>full bounds invalidated</b> - This damage is recorded anytime the
    fullBoundsCache becomes invalid.</li>
  <li><b>child bounds invalidated</b> - This damage is recorded anytime the full
    bounds of any descendant node is invalidated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Damage is repaired by PNode's validateFullBounds method at the end of the UI
cycle. That method does the following things</p>
<ol>
  <li>If the node's bounds have been invalidated, then validate them.</li>
  <li>If the node's child bounds invalidated flag is set then all of the nodes
    children a validated.</li>
  <li>Next call layoutChildren(). (this
    is an empty method in PNode, but layout manager nodes would override it).</li>
  <li>If the nodes full bounds invalidated flag is set then:
    <ol>
      <li>Record the node's old full bounds</li>
      <li>Compute the node's new full bounds</li>
      <li>If the node's full bounds have change make sure to invalidate the full
        bounds of the parent node.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The layout is now up to date, so clear the layout flags.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="Pattern 13 Updating the Display"></a>Pattern 16: Updating the
Display</h2>
<p><i>Piccolo</i><i> should paint the screen only when needed, and it should be
smart about only painting the portions of the screen that need to be painted.</i></p>
<p>Display update in Piccolo is driven from the UI Cycle, and uses the same
damage/repair design that Piccolo uses to validate bounds. When a node changes
such that it needs to be repainted it invalidates its paint, and invalidates the
child paint of all its ancestors. Later (at the end of the UI Cycle) screen
damage is collected for all nodes with invalid paint.</p>
<h1><a name="Desing Patterns for ZUI Interaces"></a>Design Patterns for ZUI Interfaces</h1>
<p>This section contains a few basic patterns the occur frequently in ZUI
interfaces, and describes how they can be implemented with Piccolo. To learn
more about using the Piccolo see <a href="#Usage Patterns For Piccolo">Usage
Patterns For Piccolo</a>, and to learn more about the Piccolo implementation see
<a href="#Implementation Patterns for Piccolo">Implementation Patterns for Piccolo</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Pattern 14 Semantic Zooming"></a>Pattern 17: Semantic Zooming</h2>
<p><i>It is useful for an object to change its visual representation based on
the scale that it is being viewed at. For example when a document is viewed from
far away (at a small scale) in a ZUI it might be best to just show that
documents title, but when the view is zoomed in all the documents content should
become visible.</i></p>
<p>To do semantic zooming in Piccolo you should override the appropriate paint
method, and then choose how the node renders itself based on the scale stored in
the paint context parameter. This example creates a new node that will paint its
based bounds filed with a blue color when viewed at a scale that is less then
one, and with an orange color when the scale is greater then one.</p>
<pre>public class SemanticNode extends PNode {
	public void paint(PPaintContext aPaintContext) {
		double s = aPaintContext.getScale();
		Graphics2D g2 = aPaintContext.getGraphics();
		
		if (s &lt; 1) {
			g2.setPaint(Color.blue);
		} else {
			g2.setPaint(Color.orange);
		}
		
		g2.fill(getBoundsReference());
	}
}</pre>
<h2><a name="Pattern 15 Sticky Objects"></a>Pattern 18: Sticky Objects</h2>
<p><i>It is useful for an object to &quot;stick&quot; to a camera, so that its
position does not change even when the camera is is zoomed and
panned.</i></p>
<p>To do this in Piccolo you should add the &quot;sticky node&quot; as a child
of the camera. The camera's view transform is only applied to the layer nodes
that it is viewing, not to its children. The children are drawn after (on top
of) the layer nodes.</p>
